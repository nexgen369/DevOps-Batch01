Top 6 DevOps Tools (Explained Clearly)
--------------------------------------
1. Git – Version Control System

* Git is a distributed **Version Control System (VCS)** used to track code changes.
* Helps developers collaborate, manage branches, and maintain code versions efficiently.

2. Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Terraform is an **IaC tool** used to automate and provision cloud infrastructure.
* Enables reproducible infrastructure using code (declarative configuration files).

3. Ansible – Configuration Management Tool

* Ansible automates **configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.
* Agentless tool (uses SSH), making it lightweight and easy to manage multiple servers.

4. Docker – Containerization Platform

* Docker packages applications and dependencies into **containers.
* Ensures consistent environment across development, testing, and production.

5. Kubernetes – Container Orchestration Platform

* Kubernetes manages and scales Docker containers in **production environments.
* Handles load balancing, self-healing, scaling, and automated deployments.

6. Jenkins – CI/CD Automation Tool

* Jenkins automates **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**.
* Integrates with Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and other tools for end-to-end automation.

What is DevOps? (Clear Explanation):
====================================
DevOps is a **culture, process, and set of practices** that bring **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** teams together.
The goal is to deliver software **faster, more frequently, and with higher quality**.

To understand DevOps, let’s compare it with real-life examples.

1. School Management System Example

50 Years Back – Old Process (Waterfall-like)
============================================
Stakeholders:

* Students
* Teachers
* Parents

Process: Only One Final Exam

* Students → Not serious from Day 1
* Teachers → Not serious from Day 1
* Parents → Worried only at the end

Result:

* Only **20–30%** pass
* Very low success rate
* Everyone reacts late → Poor results

Conclusion:
We needed to change the process.

30 Years Back – Improved Process (Agile-like)
=============================================
Unit tests, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Pre-final

Unit Test-1 (After 1.5 months):

* Students → Serious at least before 1 week
* Teachers → Serious from Day 1
* Parents → Start monitoring from Day 1

Pass percentage: 30%

Unit Test-2 → 31%

Unit Test-3, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Pre-final

Final result → 80%
Expectation → 100%

Conclusion:
Further improvement needed.


10 Years Back – Best Practice (Continuous Feedback)
====================================================
Daily slip tests + Unit tests + Term exams

* Students stay alert daily
* Teachers monitor continuously
* Parents track performance regularly

Results → 99%

Year: 365 Days , 200 Exams per year

This continuous evaluation gives **continuous improvement**, just like DevOps.

2. Software Development Models
SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle
======================================
1. Requirements
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

Waterfall Model (Old Approach – 50 Years Back)

Project duration: 2 years

Stakeholders:

* Students → Developers
* Teachers → Testers
* Parents → Clients

Problems:

* Developers → Not serious from Day 1
* Testers → Not serious from Day 1
* Clients → Worried from Day 1

After 1 year → Team becomes serious
Development → 6 months
Testing → 100 defects (10 invalid)

Delivered product:
Expected = Innova, Delivered = Maruti 800

Conclusion: Slow, no customer feedback, late delivery.

Agile Methodology (30 Years Back)
=================================
Work is divided into **Sprints (installment-based delivery)**.

Example: E-commerce Modules

1.User Management

   * Signup, Login, Forgot Password, Change Password
   * 1 month development + 1 month testing

2. Product Management

3. Cart

4. Shipping

5. Payment & Orders

User Management:

* 30 days dev + 30 days test
* 50 defects → 15 invalid
* Client testing → 10 bugs

Next Sprint: Fix previous bugs + Build next module
Expected = BMW, Delivered = Innova

Better than Waterfall but still not perfect.

DevOps with Agile (Modern Approach)
===================================
Day-1 Process

* Developer writes code
* The same day → Build (compile & package)
* Same day → Test
* Defects found early
* Only 1–2 valid defects → Easy to fix

Teams:

Dev team: Java/Python/Node.js
Ops team: Testing, Build & Release, Cloud

DevOps Goal:

Create a CI/CD pipeline where code is →
Developed → Tested → Built → Deployed
on the same day using automation tools.

3. Computers and Servers

What is a Computer?
===================
A machine that **computes** or performs tasks.

Can we call these computers?

* Mobile? → Yes
* TV? → Yes
* Server? → Yes

A server is a powerful computer used to serve data to clients.

What is a Server?

A server serves data or services to users (clients).

Examples:

* Web server → Apache, Nginx
* Database server → MySQL, PostgreSQL
* File server → Samba, NFS
* Mail server → Exchange, Postfix
* Application server → Tomcat, WebLogic
* DNS server → BIND, Microsoft DNS

Server Hardware Components

* CPU → Brain
* RAM → Temporary memory
* Motherboard → Connects components
* NIC → Network card
* Storage → HDD/SSD
* Cooling system

Server Software (OS)

* Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS…)
* Windows Server
* Mac OS

Provides:

* File system
* Process/memory management
* Network communication
* Security/user management

4. Operating System (OS)

OS = Interface between user and hardware

Types:

* Windows 10/11
* Linux Distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Kali)
* Android OS

Windows vs Linux

| Feature       | Windows           | Linux                |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Developer     | Microsoft         | Open Source          |
| Source code   | Closed            | Open                 |
| Cost          | Paid              | Free                 |
| UI            | GUI-based         | CLI-focused          |
| Customization | Limited           | Highly customizable  |
| Performance   | Slower            | Lightweight          |
| Best for      | Beginners, Gaming | Servers, Programming |

Advantages:

Windows: Easy, supports all hardware, great for gaming
Linux: Secure, stable, free, great for servers
