Topic5: File Permissions:
-------------------------
Linux file permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory
These permission are crucial for system security and user management

Types of permissions & Users
----------------------------
Three Types of permissions:

	.Read(r): View contents of a file/directory
	.Write(w): Modify file or add/remove in directory
	.Execute(x): Run file (script/program) or access directory

Three Types of Users:

	.Owner(user): who created the file/owner of the file
	.Group: User in files group
	.Others: All other users not a owner or not in group

Permission Format:
------------------	
use ls -l to see permission (E.g., -rwxrw-r--)

Breakdown: (-rwxrw-r--)

Symbol			Meaning
-				Regular file (d for directory)
rwx				Owner: read, write, Execute
rw-				Group: read, write, No permission
r--				Others: read, No permission, No permission

Numeri(Octal) Notation:
-----------------------
Each permission had a value:

	. r=4
	. w=2
	. x=1    Total value is '7'

To set permissions: "chmod 755 filename"

	Owner: rwx(7=4+2+1)
	Group: r-x(5=4+0+1)
	Others:r-x(5=4+0+1)
	
	Full permission: 777
	Zero permission: 000
